gSTM, short for Gnome SSH Tunnel Manager, is simply a Gnome2 front-end to the 
cumbersome ssh commandline to open ssh tunnels (port redirects). It also 
includes gAskpass which is a Gnome2 askpass dialog.

To install, use the usual "./configure; make; make install" routine (the latter 
as root obviously). For documentation and information, please see the website at 
http://gstm.sourceforge.net
