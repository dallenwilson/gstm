# gstm
Gnome SSH Tunnel Manager - Gtk3 Edition

This is a Gtk3 port of gstm (https://sourceforge.net/projects/gstm/).

For Gentoo users, an ebuild is available in my layman overlay: https://github.com/dallenwilson/trolltoo
Ubuntu users (and Mint, Debian and other related distros) can find a deb package in my launchpad ppa: https://launchpad.net/~dallen.wilson/+archive/ubuntu/ppa
For everyone else, release tarballs are available from Github.
